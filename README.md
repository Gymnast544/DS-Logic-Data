# DS-Logic-Data

Some logic analyzer data which I used to figure out how the touchscreen driver chip and dsi screen protocols worked. If I remember correctly they work with the Saleae logic analyzer software.

Datasheets are public for the touchscreen driver so that data was for me to understand how to read the datasheet as well as figure out the configuration of the chip.
